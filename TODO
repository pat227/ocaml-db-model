USE ZARITH for DECIMAL type,
OR Core.BIGNUM for the core branch and switch to use of dune for core branch

Actually copy the Utilities file.
And copy all the required types only found in this project at preset, such as uint64_w_sexp.ml, etc, and perhaps others soon to join them.

Look at no core branch and replicate: creating a toplevel ml file that contains all the generated modules in src/tables, and support complex types as field types...at some point in the future.

Support dune: write dune file into src/tables

Write ALL the extended module types into the generated modules
Use string not Core.String even in core branch for compatability with some ppx rewriters

Copy not just utilities2copy but also all the extended modules into src/tables/extendedtypes and create an extendedtypes.ml file to bundle them.

Use the extended types ... still writing Core.Date.t instead of Date_extended.t
